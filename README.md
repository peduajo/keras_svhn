# keras_svhn
Keras model about the shvn problem, with this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/svhn-preproccessed-fragments/data. 

I improve this kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/svhn-digit-recognition and I apply a similar architecture proposed in the
official paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6082.pdf

#STEPS 

1. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/svhn-preproccessed-fragments/data, and put it in the `housenumbers` directory (create it if you don't have it).
2. Install the dependencies with pip3 if you use PyPi with `sudo pip3 install pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras numpy ipython`
3. Execute the notebook with `ipython3 notebook svhnModel.ipynb`
